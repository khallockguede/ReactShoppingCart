# React Shopping Cart

<img src=./ReactShoppingCart.png>

## Description:
<p> This is shopping app with a restock feature. <br> The user can add and remove items from the cart which updates the "In stock" number of items. <br> The user cannot add items to the cart that are out of stock. <br>The user can click "Restock" and more stock will be added to the "Product List". </p>

## How to Run:
<p> Clone all files to a single folder. <br> <br>Strapi can be used on a localhost for the API so that the "Restock" feature will work. <br> Start a local server. </br> Open the "index.html" file and start using the app.</p>

## Future Improvements:
<p> I plan to add functionality to the "Checkout" button like an alert window with instructions on how to pay. </p>
